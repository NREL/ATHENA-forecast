# Exploratory Data Analysis

The [NorthSide.ipynb](NorthSide.ipynb) looks at the distribution of vehicles that enter and exit the control plaza from North and South entrances.

The [TerminalDistributions.ipynb](TerminalDistributions.ipynb) notebook uses the *Gate Utilization* data
to assign a percentage of total volume to each terminal.

The [CXSurvey.ipynb](CXSurvey.ipynb) explores the *Customer Satisfaction Survey* data.

The [FlightandTrafficData.ipynb](FlightandTrafficData.ipynb) notebook explores both the traffic data and flight data used in modeling curb congestion.

The [AmericanAirlinesSample.ipynb](AmericanAirlinesSample.ipynb) notebook uses sample data from American Airlines to estimate Origin/Destination and Load.

[CurbAllocations.ipynb](CurbAllocations.ipynb): A series of PDF files were converted into a CSV that describes the current curb allocation for each type of vehicle service (e.g. Taxi, personal, hotel shuttle, etc.).  This notebook looks at how well that distribution aligns with the volume of vehicles from the control plaza.
